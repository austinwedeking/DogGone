# Dog Gone
This repository contains the Unity project for Dog Gone, the first full video game I have ever worked on. This 2D platforming game was made for a freshman/sophomore level Game Design & Development course at UW-Stout.

I worked on various mechanics and systems related to the shop and currency system, level goals and transitions, level design, and UI framework / functionality.

You can view the project in its entirety from this repository, or you can download the game executable itself from itch: https://bigdevaustin.itch.io/dog-gone
